Patch for the Linux Kernel to implement "SymlinksIfOwnerMatches" features

description
-----------

This is a patch that implements a symlink protection feature in the Linux kernel.
For a configurable group all file accesses with symlinks will only be approved if
the owner of the symlink target matches the owner of the symlink.

This prevents attacks with web servers on multiuser systems. This attack was
used in the hack of Freedom Hosting II.

versions
--------

The current patch has been created for kernel 4.20.4. At the time of this writing it can
be applied to both the latest stable (4.20.4) and longterm (4.19.17) kernel.

If you get rejects when applying this patch to the latest kernel please open an issue and
I'll try to update it.
